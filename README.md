# Slide-In Gui
```
Requires AutoHotkey v2
Tested with beta13
```

When mouse is hovering on the right side of the screen, a gui will slide out. Click on the text to call a function (can be changed in file).

The text changes color when the mouse is over it.

A barely visible transparent gui will show the area the mouse needs to be in for the gui to slide out. There's instructions in the ahk file if you don't want this.
