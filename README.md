# Slide-In-Gui
When mouse is hovering on the right side of the screen, a gui will slide out. Click on the text to call a function.

There are a few variables near the top you can adjust to your liking.

Just change the callback function for the AddText controls (and the text for that matter) to what you want to do when you click an option.
Text changes color when the mouse is over it.

A barely visible transparent gui will show the area the mouse needs to be in for the gui to slide out. There's instructions in the ahk file if don't want this.
